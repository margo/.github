The Margo initiative is an open collaboration between like-minded organizations and individuals, sharing a common vision: deliver edge interoperability for industrial automation ecosystems. Margo is hosted by the Linux Foundation.
 
Our mission? Define the mechanisms for interoperability between edge applications, edge devices, and edge orchestration software in ecosystems of industrial users, paving the way to mitigate scale challenges when digitalizing their operations. Margo strives to assist industrial users in increasing the adoption of repeatable software patterns, supporting their heterogeneous ecosystems of many suppliers.
